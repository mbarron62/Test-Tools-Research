Hexawise Testing
Hexawise is a test design tool that can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of your testing. Using applied statistics-based optimization methods that have been refined over more than 40 years, Hexawise automatically generates test conditions to be executed by testers. Hexawise carefully constructs combinations of test conditions to achieve as much coverage as possible in as few tests as possible.

Justin Hunter CEO, Founder
Before founding Hexawise in 2009, Justin worked at Accenture where he led several firm-wide initiatives. He spearheaded the adoption of pair-wise test design approaches that doubled tester productivity. Justin received a CEO award for the initiative’s success. By making it easy for software testers to design efficient and effective software tests, Justin is following in his father's footsteps. Justin's father, Dr. William G. Hunter, was a leading Design of Experiments expert who worked in many industries designing experiments that were scientifically-optimized to maximize the amount of actionable information revealed in each experiment.

1. How is Hexawise different from other test design tools?

Hexawise focuses on the Test Design phase of software testing. Very few other software tools even include a Test Design function that attempts to help you achieve maximum coverage with a minimum number of Test Cases. As a result, Hexawise is complementary to – not competitive with – almost all other software testing tools. For example, many users export test case conditions from Hexawise and import them into test management tools such as HP Quick Test Pro, HP Quality Center / ALM and IBM Rational tools.

2. How to use Hexawise?

Using 2-way pairwise testing, Hexawise allows users to simply input parameters and their possible values into a spreadsheet like form. After entering the data, just click Create Tests, and Hexawise will automatically generate a list of tests in a matter of seconds.

3. Will Hexawise solve all of our testing needs?

Hexawise will consistently deliver dramatic benefits if used correctly in the vast majority of testing projects, but there are a couple important caveats to keep in mind.

With or without Hexawise, to develop effective test plans, you need the input of intelligent and thoughtful test designers. Using Hexawise will unfortunately not turn incompetent, dim-witted testers into geniuses overnight.

With or without Hexawise, testers can forget to include things. If a Hexawise user fails to include inputs that should be tested, Hexawise’s optimized test cases will also fail to include them.

You should not rely exclusively on Hexawise as single source for all of your test cases. Hexawise may well generate the significant majority of tests that should be run on an application. Even so, you should consult Subject Matter Experts to see if they would recommend supplementing the Hexawise-generated test cases with additional tests. We recommend that Hexawise be used in conjunction with multiple test design strategies. Using multiple test design strategies in combination will give you the best odds of identifying the most bugs.
